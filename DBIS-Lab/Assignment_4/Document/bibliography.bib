The numeric style of citation is quite common in scientific writing. In other disciplines, the author-year style, e.g., (Roberts, 2003), such as Harvard is preferred. A discussion about which is best will not occur here, but a possible way to get such an output is by the natbib package. In fact, it can supersede LaTeX&apos;s own citation commands, as Natbib allows the user to easily switch between Harvard or numeric.},

note = {To create a Beamer theme we need to specifiy four types of details-- colour, font, inner, outer. These details can be mentioned in the presentation theme itself or can be created as different files and then called in the TeX document. It is actually advisable to create them as separate files since this will allow us to use these specific themes with other presentation themes as well by just calling these in the TeX document. Additionally, it is also a more efficient way of working. For example, let's say that we like the overall feel of the Pittsburgh theme but just want to change the colours from blue to black. Then we need to just create the colour theme file and call it in the TeX document. This wouldn't be possible if we had just created one file with all the details. Let's just try to create a simple theme and see how it goes.},

note = {When beginning to explore the world of electricity and electronics, it is vital to start by understanding the basics of voltage, current, and resistance. These are the three basic building blocks required to manipulate and utilize electricity. At first, these concepts can be difficult to understand because we cannot “see” them. One cannot see with the naked eye the energy flowing through a wire or the voltage of a battery sitting on a table. Even the lightning in the sky, while visible, is not truly the energy exchange happening from the clouds to the earth, but a reaction in the air to the energy passing through it. In order to detect this energy transfer, we must use measurement tools such as multimeters, spectrum analyzers, and oscilloscopes to visualize what is happening with the charge in a system. Fear not, however, this tutorial will give you the basic understanding of voltage, current, and resistance and how the three relate to each other.},
