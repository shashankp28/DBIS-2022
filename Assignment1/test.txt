OLAP (for online analytical processing) is software for performing multidimensional analysis at high speeds on large volumes of data from a data 
warehouse, data mart, or some other unified, centralized data store. in a data warehouse, data sets are stored in tables, each of which can organize 
data into just two of these dimensions at a time. OLAP extracts data from multiple relational data sets and reorganizes it into a multidimensional 
format that enables very fast processing and very insightful analysis. The core of most OLAP systems, the OLAP cube is an array-based multidimensional 
database that makes it possible to process and analyze multiple data dimensions much more quickly and efficiently than a traditional relational database.
